I'm a tech enthusiast and an Information Systems student at the State University of Paraná (UENP), Brazil.
Hailing from a small town, I'm driven by curiosity and a passion for exploring, customizing, and deeply understanding how things really work. **Catholic  ✝️**

## ⚡ Technologies & Passions That Drive Me
I'm the kind of person who loves to dig deep, "get my hands dirty," and tweak technology until it feels just right.

● Front-end Development: Building responsive and user-friendly interfaces with a focus on clean code and great user experiences.

● Linux: I enjoy exploring alternative distros, the power of the terminal, and full system customization. I'm very hands-on with the "under-the-hood" work, including:
  
- System Troubleshooting: Diagnosing and fixing boot issues, dependency conflicts, and general system repair.
- Disk & Partition Management: Formatting, advanced partitioning (like fdisk/gparted), and setting up filesystems.
- Package & Repository Handling: Working with various package managers and managing software sources.
- Bare-Metal & Repair: Full system installations, dual-boot setups, and computer repair/recovery.

● Advanced Android: An enthusiast of rooting, custom ROMs, recovery mods (TWRP/OrangeFox), bootloader unlocking, and exploring Android beyond its factory settings.

● UI/UX Customization: A firm believer in interfaces that are not just beautiful, but also intuitive, smooth, and enjoyable to use.

● Crypto & Blockchain: Actively following the crypto space from wallets and market trends to blockchain technologies and the concept of decentralization.
